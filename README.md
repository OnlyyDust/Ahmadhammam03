  - scripts/batch_infer.py takes a file of inputs and writes outputs in JSONL
  - Use for offline scoring or export to a vector database

- Performance tuning:
  - Increase worker count for CPU-bound work
  - Use batching in the request handler for GPU-bound models
  - Use half-precision where acceptable

Export and acceleration
- ONNX:

  - Values file sets replicas, resource requests, and autoscaling thresholds.

- Example apply:
  kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

- Autoscaling:
  - Use custom Prometheus metrics to scale by GPU utilization or request latency
  - HPA can use external metrics for model-specific behavior

Alibaba Cloud integration
- Pattern registry:
  - ECS for VM-based workloads
  - Container Registry (ACR) for images
  - Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) for managed K8s
  - Function Compute for event-driven inference

    - build image
    - push to registry
    - create release

- Model CI:
  - Validate models via unit tests for numeric stability
  - Run smoke inference tests in CI: load model and run a sample input
  - Run reproducibility check by comparing outputs to a baseline

- Canary and blue/green:
  - Blue/green deployment manifests in k8s/blue_green/
  - Canary controller examples for rollout by traffic weight

Monitoring and observability
- Metrics:
  - Expose Prometheus metrics for request latency, error rate, queue depth, GPU utilization
  - Metrics endpoint: /metrics

- Logging:
  - Structured JSON logs with request id, latency, and model version
  - Integrate with Alibaba Cloud Log Service or your ELK stack

  - Correlate traces with logs and metrics

- Dashboards:
  - Grafana dashboards example in k8s/monitoring/grafana/
  - Panels for request latency P50/P95, GPU utilization, and active requests

Performance and scaling tips
- Use fp16 for faster inference and lower memory when accuracy permits.
- Use batching in inference. Batch size should match GPU memory and latency targets.
- Use model sharding for very large models across GPUs or nodes.
- Profile hotspots with PyTorch profiler and NVIDIA Nsight.
- Tune data pipeline: prefetch, pin_memory, and num_workers for DataLoader.
- Cache tokenization outputs for repeated inference workloads.
- Warm up the model before measuring steady-state latency.

Debugging and profiling
- Use torch.profiler to collect CPU and GPU traces.
- Sample trace command:
  python -m torch.profiler --output trace.json src/train.py --config configs/...
- Visualize with TensorBoard or chrome://tracing.

Security
- Use encrypted storage for model artifacts and secrets.
- Avoid embedding API keys in code. Use environment variables or secret managers.
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- Apply RBAC policies for Kubernetes clusters.

Reproducibility
- Pin dependencies in requirements.txt.
- Record random seeds in training logs.
- Save training config alongside checkpoints.
- Use deterministic flags for PyTorch where possible, while noting performance trade-offs.

2) Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern
- Use case: answer questions over a domain corpus.
- Components:
  - Embedding model to generate vector store
  - Vector DB (FAISS, Milvus, or OpenSearch)

- Steps:
  - Create embeddings:
    python scripts/create_embeddings.py --model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 --corpus data/wiki.jsonl --out vectors/index.faiss
  - Serve embeddings + retrieval as sidecar
  - Fine-tune generator with retrieved context

3) Large model sharding
- Use case: >100B parameter model across multiple GPUs
- Strategy:
  - Use model parallelism (FSDP or tensor parallel)
  - Shard optimizer states
